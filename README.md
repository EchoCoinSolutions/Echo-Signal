# Echo Signal System

- Detects randomized anomalies:
  - SIG-FRAG/221 (Fragmented)
  - SIG-SUP/110 (Suppressed)
  - SIG-COR/089 (Corrupted)
  - or confirms normal signal
- Built to represent symbolic fallback behavior

## 🔧 How to Use

## 🌐 Hosting
To deploy live:

## 🧠 Intent
This is a symbolic signal node. It is not for profit or trading. It exists to reflect collapse and confirm visibility for those who feel unseen.
